Add php-serve.py to your PATH, then, from whatever directory is the root
of your PHP application, just run:

    $ php-serve.py

You can optionally specify a port number as an argument. By default,
port 8000 is used:

    $ php-serve.py 8000

php-serve.py uses wphp and so has the same restrictions, including no
current support for mod_rewrite. Other than that, it mostly works.
