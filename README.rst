Some useful shell profile stuff, mostly for bash, but also covers git, vim,
etc. Just helps set up the environment I like.


Checking it Out
===============

I usually have to ``git clone`` this repo, then move everything (especially the
``.git`` directory and things that start with ``.``) to my homedir. Maybe
there's an easier way.


Terminal Titles
===============

If you can, copy ``~/bin/bash-prompt-*`` into ``/etc/sysconfig/`` on
Fedora/RHEL/CentOS systems. Then everyone will get nice, shorter terminal tab
titles. If not, I still get them, anyway.
